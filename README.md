## Introduction

[Monica](https://monicahq.com/) is an open-source web application to organize the interactions with your
loved ones.

**Rachel** is a Google Chrome extension which allows you to parse your Facebook account to add the contacts you need on Monica.

## Get Started

Rachel is still far from being ready for production, so it is not available on the Google Chrome store yet.

You can still install the extension by building it from a node environnement. Node 8 is recommended. Node 6 should work but has not yet been tested.

1) Clone the project

2) Install dependencies (you can also use yarn)
```
$ npm install 
```

3) Build the files in production
```
$ npm run build
```

4) Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu and select Extensions under the More Tools menu to get to the same place).

4) Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog. 

5) Navigate to the dist directory (generated by the previous command) in your project folder directory, and select it.
